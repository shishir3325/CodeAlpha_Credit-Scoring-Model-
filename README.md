# CodeAlpha_Credit-Scoring-Model-
ML model to predict credit approval using structured financial data
# Credit Scoring Prediction Model 
This project predicts whether a loan will be approved or rejected using machine learning models trained on real-world financial data.

## About the Project
- Predicts loan approval status based on features like income, CIBIL score, assets, etc.
- Trained 3 models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
- Evaluated using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib  

## Result
- **Best Accuracy:** 98.0%

## Dataset
- Dataset used: `loan_approval_dataset.csv`

## How to Run
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
